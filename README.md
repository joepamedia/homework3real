  # Description 
  ### I wanted to build this in order to create a password that allowed me to select lower case, upper case, numbers, and special characters I built this project to create secure passwords quickly. This solves the time it takes to think of a password that can potentially become breached.  I learned how to create arrays of characters and have them randomly selected to become a password
